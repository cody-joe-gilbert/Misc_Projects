# Fluid Dynamics Recitation Leader Material

This folder contains the 11 recitation documents I created to teach the Spring 2019 NYU Fluid Dynamics Recitation. Each week introduced topics to enhance student participation and contribute to the lectures taught by Professor Antoine Cerfon. Each of the `recitationN.pdf` files correspond to the recitation material presented in the N-th week.
