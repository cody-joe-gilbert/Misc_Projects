# Statistical Learning Projects with R

This folder contains two statistical/machine learning projects created in R during the course of a Statistical Learning course at New York's Hunter College. To save space, the underlying data sets have been ommitted but can be found in the respective paper's citations.

## Mushroom Classification
This project used an open source data set of mushroom features and their classifiction of "toxic" or "edible" to train a machine learning model to predict mushroom toxicity. The code is contained within `./mushroom_classification/MushroomClassification.R` and writeup in `./mushroom_classification/MushroomClassification.pdf`

## Higgs Boson Prediction
This project used particle accelerator simulation data to attempt to predict the presence of a Higgs Boson using machine learning. The code is contained within `./higgs_boson_prediction/higgs_boson_prediction.R` and writeup in `./higgs_boson_prediction/higgs_boson_prediction_writeup.pdf`
