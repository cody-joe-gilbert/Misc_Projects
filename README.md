# Misc. Projects Repository

This repository contains projects I've worked on in the past that aren't large enough for dedicated repositories. Each project has its own README in it's subdirectory for additional details.

#### AI Projects
`ai_projects_python` contains AI project(s) created during an NYU Artificial Intelligence course.

#### Brunswick Core Reload
`brunswick_core_reload` contains a description of the nuclear core reloads of the Brunswick Nuclear Plant in which I was involved during my career as a nuclear fuel engineer. This folder contains only a README description and a local copy of a published document I created as all other files are owned by Duke Energy.

#### Operating System Simulation Projects
`operating_systems_cpp` contains the C++ programs I created to simulate operation system components during an NYU Operation Systems course.

#### Machine Learning Projects
`statistical_learning_r` contains machine learning projects created with R during a Hunter College course in Statistical Learning.

#### Fluid Dynamics Recitation Leader Material
`fluid_dynamics_recitation` contains the NYU Spring 2019 Fluid Dynamics recitation material I created while working as a recitation leader.
