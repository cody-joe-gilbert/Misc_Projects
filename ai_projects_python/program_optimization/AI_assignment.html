</head><body><h1> Programming Assignment 2 </h1>

<p>
Assigned: Feb. 25<br>
Due: Apr. 1

</p><h3> Overview </h3>

<p>
In this assignment, you are to implement the Davis-Putnam algorithm and use
it to solve a simple parallel program optimization problem.

</p><p>
The problem is as follows. You are given 
</p><ul>
<li>(1) a collection of N memory locations (registers).
</li><li>(2) a complete specification of the values in the locations at time 0
</li><li>(3) a time limit K &lt; N.
</li><li>(4) a goal of the arrangement of values in the registers at time K.
</li></ul>

<p>
The problem is to generate a timed sequence of parallel assignment
statements that will achieve the goal, starting from the start state.
The usual rule for mutual exclusion on readers/writers applies:
the same source can be multiply
read in a given time cycle, but a source cannot be both read and written to in
a given time cycle, and certainly cannot be multiply written to in a given
time cycle.

</p><p>
<b> Example 1 </b> <br>
Start:  R1 = A, R2 = B, R3 = C, R4 = D. <br>
Goal:   R2 = A, R3 = A, R4 = C. <br>
K = 2.

</p><p>
<b> Solution </b> <br>
Cycle 1: R2 = R1; R4 = R3. <br>
Cycle 2: R3 = R1.

</p><p>
<b> Example 2 </b> <br>
Start:  R1 = A, R2 = A, R3 = B, R4 = B. <br>
Goal:   R1 = B, R2 = B, R3 = A, R4 = A. <br>
K = 2.

</p><p>
<b> Solution </b> <br>
Cycle 1: R3 = R1; R2 = R4. <br>
Cycle 2: R1 = R2; R4 = R3.

</p><p>
<b> Example 3: </b> <br>
Start:  R1 = A, R2 = B, R3 = C. <br>
End: R1 = B, R2 = A. <br>
K = 2 <br>
<b> No solution </b>


</p><p>
<b> Example 4: </b> <br>
Start:  R1 = A, R2 = B, R3 = C. <br>
End: R1 = B, R2 = A. <br>
K = 3 


</p><p>
<b> Solution </b> <br>
Cycle 1: R3 = R1  <br>
Cycle 2: R1 = R2 <br>
Cycle 3: R2 = R3

</p><p>
<b> Example 5: </b> <br>
Start:  R1 = A, R2 = B, R3 = C. <br>
End: R1 = B, R2 = A. R3 = C. <br>
K = 3 <br>
<b> No solution </b>

</p><p>
(I think --- I am not 100% sure --- that there is actually a polynomial time 
algorithm for this, but ignore that fact.)


</p><p>
You will write three programs.
</p><ol>
<li>  An implementation of the Davis-Putnam procedure, which takes 
as input a set of clauses and outputs either a satisfying valuation, 
or a statement that the clauses cannot be satisfied.
</li><li>  A front end, which takes as input a  problem specification
and outputs  a set of clauses that can be input to (1).
</li><li>  A back end, which takes as input the output of (1) and
translates it into a solution to the original problem.
</li></ol>

<h3> Compiling the programming problem to propositional logic </h3>
Any problem instance can be expressed propositionally as follows: 

<h3> Atoms </h3>
There are two kinds of atoms
<ul>
<li>1. Value(R,V,I). The value of register R at time I is value V.
</li><li>2. Assign(RA, RB, I). The statement "RA = RB" is executed at time I.
</li></ul>

<p>
If there is
a maximum of K steps, then for each time I=0 ... K,
there should be an atom Value(R,V,I) for each register R and value V. <br>
For each I=0 .. K-1 there should be an atom Assign(RA,RB,I) for each
pair of registers RA, RB.


</p><h3> Axioms </h3>
There are 6 types of axioms.

<p><b> Unique value </b> <br>
If Value(R,VX,I) and VY is any value not equal to VX then not Value(R,VY,I)

</p><p><b> Positive effects of actions </b> <br>
If Assign(RA,RB,I) and Value(RB,V,I) then Value(RA,V,I+1).

</p><p><b> Frame axiom (no change if no assignment) </b>
If Value(R,VX,I) and not Assign(R,R1,I) and not Assign(R,R2,I) and ... and 
not Assign(R,Rn,I) then Value(R,VX,I+1)

</p><p> <b> Incompatible assignments</b>
For any three distinct registers RA, RB, RC, if
Assign(RA,RB,I) then not Assign(RB,RA,I); not Assign(RA,RC,I); and not 
Assign(RB,RC,I).

</p><p> <b> Starting state. </b>
Value(R,V,0) for each register R and its value V at time 0.

</p><p> <b> Goal state. </b> 
Value(R,V,K) for each register R and its goal value V.

</p><h3> Specifications </h3>
<h4> Input / Output. </h4>
All three programs take their input from a text file 
produce their output to a text file. (If you want, you may use 
standard input and output.)


<h4> Davis-Putnam </h4>
The input to the Davis-Putnam procedure has the following form:
An atom is denoted by a natural number: 1,2,3 ...  The literal P
is the same number as atom P; the literal ~P is the negative.
A clause is a line of text containing the integers of the corresponding
literals.  After all the clauses have been given, the next line is the
single value 0; anything further in the file is ignored in the 
execution of the procedure and reproduced at the end of the output file.
(This is the mechanism we will use to allow the front end to communicate
to the back end.)

<p>
The output from the Davis-Putnam procedure has the following form:
First, a list of pairs of atom (a natural number) and truth value
(either T or F).  Second, a line containing the single value 0. Third,
the back matter from the input file, reproduced.

</p><p>
Example: Given the input
</p><pre>1 2 3 
-2 3 
-3 
0 
This is a simple example with 3 clauses and 3 atoms.
</pre>






Davis-Putnam will generate the output
<pre>1 T 
2 F
3 F
0 
This is a simple example with 3 clauses and 3 atoms.
</pre>

This corresponds to the clauses
<pre>P V Q V R. 
~Q V R. 
~R. 
</pre>


<p>
If the clauses have no solution, then Davis-Putnam outputs a single
line containing a 0, followed by the back-matter in the input file.

</p><p>
Note: Your implementation of Davis-Putnam must work on <em>any</em> 
set of clauses,
not just those that are generated by the Maze program.

</p><p>
You may assume that there are no more than 1000 atoms and no more than 10,000
clauses.



</p><h4> Front end </h4>
The front end takes as input a problem specification 
and generates as
output a set of clauses to be satisfied.

<p>
The format of the input contains the following elements
</p><ul>
<li> First line: A list of alternative registers and values at the start
state, separated by white space. Assume that the
registers are numbers in increasing order and that the value are simple
alphabetical symbols. 
</li><li>  Second line: A specification of the goal state: same format as first
line.
</li><li>  Third line: The time limit K,
</li></ul>

For example, for problem 1, the input is.

<pre>1 A 2 B 3 C 4 D
2 A 3 A 4 C
2
</pre>
<p>
You may assume that the input
is correctly formatted.  You do not have to do any error checking on the 
input. 




The output consists of
</p><ul>
<li> 1. A set of clauses suitable for inputting to Davis-Putnam as described
above.  

</li><li> 2. A key to allow the back end to  translate the numbers used for 
propositional atoms in
the clauses into the correct path.
The format of this is up to you.
My suggestion would be that, for each action atom A, you have a line of
the form "proposition-number A"
</li></ul>


<h4> Back-end </h4>
The back end takes as input the output that Davis-Putnam generates when run
on the output of the front end.  It outputs the solution in the form of the 
above examples.

If the input indicates that the clauses have no solution, the back end
should output the message "No Solution".

<h3> Another example for Davis-Putnam </h3>
The following is the input-output pair just for the Davis-Putnam module ---
<em> not </em> the front and back ends --- corresponding to the example
in the class notes.
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/faculty/davise/ai/dp-in2.txt"> 
Input for Davis-Putnam </a> 
</li><li> <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/faculty/davise/ai/dp-out2.txt"> 
Output from Davis-Putnam </a> 
</li></ul>

<h3> Deliverable </h3>
You should upload to the NYU Classes site
(a) the source code; (b) instructions for running it,
if there's anything at all non-obvious about it.  Nothing else.


<h3> Grading </h3>
The Davis-Putnam program is worth 60% of the grade; the front end is worth
35%; the back end is worth 5%.  In each of these,  a program that does
not compile will get a maximum of 10%; a correct program 
will get 90%; the remaining 10% is for being well-written and
well commented.
